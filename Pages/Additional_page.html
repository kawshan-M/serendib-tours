	<h3 id="colombo">Colombo</h3>
	<img src="../images/colombo1.jpeg" alt="colombo" width="400" height="375" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
	<p>Colombo is Sri Lanka's commercial capital and the country's most populous metropolis. The Brookings Institution
		estimates that the Colombo metropolitan region has a population of 5.6 million people, with 752,993 people
		living in the Municipality. It is both the island's financial center and a popular tourist destination. It's on
		the island's west coast, close to the Greater Colombo area, which includes Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte, Sri
		Lanka's legislative capital, and Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia. Because Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte is located inside the
		urban/suburban area of Colombo, it is frequently referred to be the capital. It serves as the administrative
		capital of the Western Province as well as the district capital of the Colombo District. Colombo is a busy and
		vibrant city with a blend of modern and traditional cultures, buildings, and monuments.</p>
	<p>Colombo was known to ancient traders 2,000 years ago due to its enormous harbor and strategic location along the
		Eastâ€“West Sea trading routes. Until Sri Lanka was ceded to the British Empire in 1815, it was designated as the
		island's capital, and its status as such was maintained when the country gained independence in 1948. Colombo
		was recognized as Sri Lanka's commercial capital in 1978, when administrative functions were shifted to Sri
		Jayewardenepura Kotte.</p><br>

	<h3 id="kandy">Kandy</h3>
	<img src="../images/kandy1.jpeg" alt="kandy" width="400" height="375" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
	<p>It is the capital of the Central Province of modern Sri Lanka and the island's second-largest metropolis. It was
		Sri Lanka's final capital during the reign of the ancient rulers. The city is located in the Kandy plateau,
		which runs through a region of tropical plantations, primarily tea. Kandy is the capital of the Central Province
		and serves as both an administrative and religious center. The "Temple of the Tooth Relic," one of the most
		important places of worship in Buddhism, is located in Kandy. In 1988, UNESCO designated it as a world historic
		site. Historically, the local Buddhist kings have fought colonial expansion and occupation by the Portuguese,
		Dutch, and British.</p>
	<p>Its geographical location has made it a key transportation hub on the island: Kandy is the gateway to Sri Lanka's
		Central Highlands, and it can be reached by major highways from all directions. The railway line goes from
		Colombo, the western coast's seaport, through Kandy to Badulla, the farthest point in the Central Highlands. The
		main roads from Colombo to Kandy and Kandy to Nuwara Eliya are two of Sri Lanka's most scenic routes, passing
		through rubber fields and continuous tea plantations. Both highways wind up and around the ring of hills,
		clawing their way up.</p><br>

	<h3 id="nuwaraeliya">Nuwara-Eliya</h3>
	<img src="../images/nuwaraeliya1.jpeg" alt="nuwarae;i" width="400" height="375"
		style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
	<p>Nuwara Eliya is a city in the Central Province's hill country. Its name means "city of light" or "city on the
		plain (table land). The city, which has a gorgeous environment and a temperate temperature, is the
		administrative center of the Nuwara Eliya District. It is the most important area for tea production in Sri
		Lanka, with an elevation of 1,868 meters (6,128 feet). Pidurutalagala, Sri Lanka's tallest peak, towers over the
		city. Nuwara Eliya is noted for having the coolest climate in Sri Lanka, with a moderate climate.</p>
	<p>Samuel Baker, the explorer of Lake Albert and the upper Nile, founded the settlement in 1846. The environment of
		Nuwara Eliya lent itself to being Ceylon's primary refuge for British civil officials and planters. Little
		England, or Nuwara Eliya, was a hill country getaway where British colonialists could indulge in their favorite
		sports of fox hunting, deer hunting, elephant hunting, polo, golf, and cricket.</p>
	<p>The Queen's Cottage, General's House, Grand Hotel, Hill Club, St Andrew's Hotel, and Town Post Office are just a
		few of the structures that have colonial aspects. The colonial style is frequently used to design and decorate
		new hotels. Visitors to the city can immerse themselves in the nostalgia of bygone eras by visiting the city's
		landmark structures. Many private residences keep their classic English-style lawns and gardens in good
		condition.</p><br>

	<h3 id="galle">Galle</h3>
	<img src="../images/galle1.jpeg" alt="galle" width="400" height="375" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
	<p>Galle is a large city in Sri Lanka, located 119 kilometers from Colombo on the island's southwestern corner.
		Galle is the capital of Galle District and the provincial headquarters and major city in Sri Lanka's Southern
		Province.</p>
	<p>Before the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century, Galle was known as Gimhathiththa, and it was the island's
		primary harbor. It was called Qali by Ibn Batuta, a Moroccan Berber Muslim traveler in the 14th century. During
		the Dutch colonial period in the 18th century, Galle achieved its pinnacle of growth. Galle is the outstanding
		example of a Portuguese-built fortified city in South and Southeast Asia, demonstrating the confluence of
		Portuguese architectural styles and native traditions. The Dutch fortified the city significantly in the 17th
		century, starting in 1649. The Galle fort is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Asia's largest remaining
		European-built fortress.</p>
	<p>The city's natural port, the National Maritime Museum, St. Mary's Cathedral, constructed by Jesuit monks, one of
		the island's largest Shiva temples, and Amangalla, the old luxury hotel, are all notable attractions in Galle.
		On December 26, 2004, the city was wracked by a large tsunami triggered by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake,
		which struck a thousand miles off the coast of Indonesia. Thousands of people were killed in only the city.
		Galle is home to the Galle International Stadium, which is regarded as one of the world's most beautiful cricket
		grounds. [3] The ground, which had been badly damaged by the tsunami, was restored, and test matches were
		resumed on December 18, 2007.</p>
	<p>Rumassala in Unawatuna, a massive mound-like hill that provides the eastern defensive barrier to Galle Harbour,
		is an important natural geographical feature in Galle. The Ramayana, one of the great Hindu epics, is linked to
		some of the events on this hill, according to local legend. The Gin Ganga, which flows from Gongala Kanda to
		Gintota, passes through villages such as Neluwa, Nagoda, Baddegama, Thelikada, and Wakwella before reaching the
		sea. The Wakwella Bridge spans the river at Wakwella.</p><br>

	<h3 id="trincomalee">Trincomalee</h3>
	<img src="../images/trincomalee1.jpeg" alt="Trincomalee" width="400" height="375"
		style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
	<p>Trincomalee, also known as Gokanna/Gokarna, is the administrative capital of the Trincomalee District and a
		popular tourist destination in Sri Lanka's Eastern Province. Located 237 kilometers north-east of Colombo, 182
		kilometers south-east of Jaffna, and 111 kilometers north of Batticaloa, on the east coast of the island, facing
		the Trincomalee Harbour. With a population of 99,135, it is the largest city in the state. The famed Koneswaram
		temple is located in Trincomalee city, from which it derived its old Tamil name Thirukonamalai. The Trincomalee
		railway station, as well as an ancient ferry service to Jaffna and the south side of the harbour at Muttur, are
		located in Trincomalee.</p>
	<p>Trincomalee's known history dates back over two and a half thousand years, beginning with a pre-modern civilian
		community associated with the Koneswaram temple. It has functioned as an important marine seaport throughout the
		island's international commerce history with South East Asia, and it is one of Asia's oldest cities. Some of
		Asia's first medical research took place in Kankuveli, a suburb of Chennai, at the "Agathiyar Thapanam," the
		Siddhar Tamil medical university founded by Agastya, which helped spread Tamil Tamraparniyan culture across the
		continent. It was successively the capital of eastern kingdoms of the Vanni nation in the ancient world,
		developing through the Koneswaram shrine's revenue under the Anuradhapura Monarchy, Pallava Dynasty, Chola
		Dynasty, Pandyan Dynasty, Vannimai chieftaincies, and the Jaffna kingdom.</p>
	<p>Following the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom, Trincomalee was transformed into a fortified port town,
		passing through the hands of the Danish in 1620, the Dutch, the French after a battle during the American
		Revolutionary War, and the British in 1795 before being absorbed into the British Ceylon state in 1815. The
		city's architecture is one of the outstanding instances of local and European styles interacting. The city also
		boasts the island's largest Dutch fort.</p>
	<p>The harbor is known for its size and security; unlike any other in the Indian Ocean, it is open to all ships in
		all weathers. It has been called the "finest harbor in the world" and "the most precious colonial possession on
		the globe," with the British calling it "the most valuable colonial possession on the planet, as affording our
		Indian Empire a security that it had not enjoyed from elsewhere." Its beaches at Uppuveli, Salli, and Nilaveli,
		which are used for temple visits, surfing, scuba diving, fishing, and whale watching, as well as the Kanniya Hot
		Springs, are popular tourist sites.</p><br>

	<h3 id="jaffna">Jaffna</h3>
	<img src="../images/jaffna1.jpeg" alt="jaffna" width="400" height="375" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
	<p>Jaffna is the capital city of Sri Lanka's Northern Province. It is the administrative center of the Jaffna
		District, which is located on the same-named peninsula. Jaffna is Sri Lanka's 12th most populous city, with an
		estimated population of 88,138 in 2012. Kandarodai, which served as an emporium in the Jaffna peninsula from
		classical antiquity, is about six miles (9.7 kilometers) from Jaffna. The capital of the four-century-long
		medieval Jaffna Kingdom was Nallur, a suburb of Jaffna.</p>
	<p>It was Sri Lanka's second most populated city after Colombo before to the Sri Lankan Civil War. Insurgent
		uprisings in the 1980s resulted in considerable damage, the deportation of a portion of the population, and
		military occupation. Refugees and internally displaced people have been returning to their homes since the
		conclusion of the civil conflict in 2009, while government and private sector rehabilitation has begun. Jaffna
		has always been a contentious city. During the Portuguese takeover of the Jaffna peninsula in 1619, it was
		transformed into a colonial port town, which was later ceded to the Dutch, who then lost it to the British in
		1796. In 1986, the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) controlled Jaffna during the civil war. In
		1987, the city was briefly seized by the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). From 1989 to 1995, the LTTE held the
		city again, until the Sri Lankan Army reclaimed control.</p>
	<p>Sri Lankan Tamils make up the majority of the city's population, with Sri Lankan Moors, Indian Tamils, and other
		ethnic groups being present prior to the civil conflict. Christians, Muslims, and a small Buddhist minority make
		up the majority of Sri Lankan Tamils. A variety of educational institutions founded during the colonial and
		post-colonial periods are located in the city. There are also a number of business establishments, minor
		industrial units, banks, hotels, and other government organizations in the area. Many historical sites may be
		found here, including the popular Jaffna library, which was burned down and rebuilt, and the Jaffna fort, which
		was rebuilt during the Dutch colonial period.</p><br>
